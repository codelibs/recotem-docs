Clicking on "Preview results" and then "Sample" will give you a preview of what items will be recommended to users with what behavioral history (which will be randomly selected):

If you have uploaded the metadata of your items in the [data management screen](../data-list/), you can link the metadata with the action history and the recommendation results to understand the behavior of the model more intuitively:
