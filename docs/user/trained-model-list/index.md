Each model displays its status (PENDING / RUNNING / COMPLETED / FAILED), the model configuration name used, and the creation date.

Click a row to navigate to the [Model Detail View](../trained-model-detail/).

To train a new model, click the **"Train New Model"** button to go to the [Model Training View](../start-training/).

You can also select multiple models to perform a [Model Comparison](../model-comparison/).
